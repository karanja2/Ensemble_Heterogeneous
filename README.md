# Ensemble_Heterogeneous
## Introduction
Ensemble learning is a popular technique in machine learning where multiple models are trained to solve the same problem and their outputs are combined to make a final prediction. The idea is that the ensemble of models can perform better than any individual model alone.

In the case of heterogeneous ensembles, the models used are different in terms of their architecture or learning algorithm. By combining models that are different from each other, we can leverage their complementary strengths and improve the overall performance of the ensemble.

This repository provides an implementation of a heterogeneous ensemble in machine learning. It is designed to be a flexible and customizable framework that can be used to combine any number of different models.
## Usage
To use the heterogeneous ensemble, you need to define a list of models that you want to use. Each model should be an instance of a machine learning model that you have previously trained.
## Conclusion
The heterogeneous ensemble provided in this repository is a powerful tool for improving the performance of machine learning models. By combining models that are different from each other, we can leverage their complementary strengths and achieve better results than any individual model alone. The package is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to easily create your own ensembles tailored to your specific needs.
